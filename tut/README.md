## Python Tutorial

### Based on tutorial by Derek Banas

[Derek's github][derek's github]

Just minor alterations to this over time as I
refreshed my knowledge of python.
Took a look at some additional modules,
Typer and FastAPI is in the works.

I've added and altered existing annotation.
On my [stream][Abstract Software Stream] I explain some of my reasoning
for those who are interested.
